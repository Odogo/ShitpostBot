## About
The Shitpost Bot Project (SBP) is a Discord Bot that aims to be the all-in-one solution to every bot out there, all without paying a single penny. Forget having the simplest features locked behind a paywall or some scummy corporations overcharging for a lifetime plan; this bot includes it all and more. This bot includes features most bots include [^1] alongside its additional features that may further assist you in your server management needs.

### History
Originally, SBP was founded as a private music bot and was even further emphasized when some popular music bots were issued a cease and desist letter by YouTube/Google.

But the project shifted after noticing the number of features that discord bot hides behind an intense paywall or the support of NFTs (lookin' at you *Mee6*), and those features were further expanded on by adding some additional functions, if applicable.

### Access
Gaining access to this bot is a simple process. SBP is "invitation only", you can only gain access by submitting a request form. As per the attached [license](./LICENSE.md), we ask that you do not use your code without any modifications. Submit a request to get access to the bot. Read the [full licnese](./LICENSE.md) for more information.

The invitation-only access might change later, depending on how it goes with the closed beta test, but as of now, it's invitation-only. A form link will be put somewhere here for you to submit access.

### Supporting
Supporting this project by donation or other means is by no means necessary and will not grant you any additional features towards the bot. Potentially grant early testing access or polls for the next feature to add.
