## About
Shitpost Bot is a Discord bot that aims to be the one all solution to any bot, without needing to pay a single penny to anyone. To achieve this aim, features of other bots (in addition to it's own advanced features) are incoroporated in it's own "shitposting" way. [^1]

| :warning: This bot is private, and requires a request to be made to invite the bot into your server. |

| If you wish to achieve such, let Odogo know you'd be interested in having this bot. [^2] |

### Supporting

[^1]:  Granted, some of these features are standard to "what most bot should include", but adding them is just nice in my opinion. They're helpful, ok?
