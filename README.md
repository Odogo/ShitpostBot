## About
The Shitpost Bot Project (SBP) is a Discord Bot project that's sole objective to be an all-in-one solution. These features are provided to you at **zero cost**, which is impressive when every bot has some sort of premium feature. This project will contain no such "premium feature(s)", and it's license prohibits any commerical use of this bot. The only money that this project will *ever* generate is anyone who considers to support this project or developers by donation, which is by no means neccessary (see **Supporting** below).

To further emphasize, this project contains features that are common among most bots, including some premium selections. Additionally some features might have additional features that are added to further assist guild owners in their quest to keep their community how they like it to be.

### History
The history of this project dates back to 2021, when YouTube/Google issues a couple of *cease and desist* letters to some of the popular music bot, and was designed to become a private music bot for a small community server of friends. Now, as more and more bots come out, they lock features behind a expensive payment barrier or additionally support NFTs or cryptocurrencies. The project and it's developers are against NFTs and cryptocurrencies, and have zero future in investing in them. Additionally, the expensive payment barrier wont be an issue, as no features will be locked behind a payment wall.

### Access
ShitpostBot may only be accessed through invitation or application process. The application is, at this time of writing, not accessible. This project is still in development.

**Note:** SBP being "invitation only" access may change at a later date once the project advances further.

### Supporting
Supporting SBP or it's developers in regards to this project by no means will grant you "additional features" to the bot itself, however, you may receive an opportunity to pick which feature gets added next into the project. Additionally, you may receive access to a PTB (Private Test Beta) version of the bot codenamed "TestpostBot". Besides these, you will not receive any special treatment or additional features.
