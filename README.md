## About
Shitpost Bot is a Discord bot that aims to be the one all solution to any bot, without needing to pay a single penny to anyone. To achieve this aim, features of other bots (in addition to it's own advanced features) are incoroporated in it's own "shitposting" way. [^1]

The Shitpost Bot Project (SBP) is a Discord Bot that aims to be the all-in-one solution to every bot out there, all without paying a single penny. Forget having the simpliest features locked being a paywall or some scummy corporations overcharging for a lifetime plan, this bot includes it all and more. This bot includes features most bots include [^1] along side it's own additional features that may actually further assist you in your server management needs.

### History
Originally, SBP was originally founded as a private music bot and even further emphasized when some of the popular music bots were issued a cease and desist letter by YouTube/Google.

But the project shifted after noticing the number of features that discord bot hide behind a intense paywall or the support of NFTs (lookin' at you *Mee6*), and those features were further expanded on by adding some additional functions, if applicable.

### Access
Gaining access to this bot is a simple process. Initially, SBP is "invitation only". You can only gain access by submitting a request form. As per the attached [license](./LICENSE.md), we ask that you do not use the own code without any modifications. Submit a request to get access the bot. Read the [full licnese](./LICENSE.md) for more information.

The invitation only access might change later, depending on how it goes with the closed beta test, but as of now, it's invitation only. A form link will be put somewhere here for you to submit access for.

### Supporting
Supporting this project, by donation or other means, is by no means neccessary and will not grant you any additional features towards the bot. Potentially will grant early testing access or polls for the next feature to add.

[^1]:  Granted, some of these features are standard to "what most bot should include", but adding them is just nice in my opinion. They're helpful, ok?
