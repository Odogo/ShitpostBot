## About
Shitpost Bot is a discord bot aimed to remove the scum that is premium bots. It is designed to be user friendly for the end user and easy to access without paying a single dime to any Discord Bot out there.

This is achieved by custom written code using 3rd party libraries *(thank you library authors <3)* to give a similar experience to what a normal bot would be.
