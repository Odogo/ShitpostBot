# ShitpostBot

## v3.1.0

The ShitpostBot is a Discord bot developed by Odogo for her friends to use in their servers.
This bot's intention is to mainly give the server owner's the ability to what they wish with their server,
without having to pay a single dime, since most bots these days lock shit behind a paywall.
